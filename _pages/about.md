I am a Post-Doc at the [MT unit of FBK](https://mt.fbk.eu), located in the beautiful [Trento](https://www.google.com/search?q=Trento), in the middle of the Dolomites!
I obtained my PhD in Computer Science in 2023 at the University of Trento (Italy) with a thesis on Speech-to-Text translation and the MS in 2015 in computer engineering from the Politecnico di Torino (my hometown) with a thesis on text clustering. Before starting my PhD, I worked for 4 years in big data computing, becoming an [Apache Spark](https://github.com/apache/spark) contributor and [Apache Livy](https://github.com/apache/incubator-livy/) PPMC member.

My resaerch interests include:

 - speech/text translation (and everything related to this, such as subtitling);
 - deep learning;
 - automatic testing;
 - ... and as everyone who has the bad luck of working with me software quality and engineering!



In my free time, I like great food and wines (of course, I am Italian!), watching and practicing sports (football first of all). And I love animals, especially my beloved tortoises!
